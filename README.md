# Game rules and Extra Features
- To make this game as simple as possible, we only make the game contain only two rounds: day and night. The initial sun for day round is 2000 and for night round is 3000.
  The first round (day round) design with 50 zombies and 6 kinds of zombies (Normal Zombie, Flag Zombie, ConeHead Zombie, BucketHead Zombie and Newspaper Zombie) and 6 kinds of plants (Sunflower, Peashooter, Repeater, Snow Pea, Gatling Pea and Wallnut)
  The second round (night round) is more complicated. We add another kind of zombie is Snow Zombie (tougher and faster) and two kinds of plants (Sunshroom and Puffshroom). We also increase the number of zombies we have to kill in order to win to 80 zombies.
- Besides that, we added some extra features. The first one is the Christmas theme. Since it is nearly holiday time so we add Christmas background and some holiday outfits for both zombies and plants. Second, we add another kind of zombie is Snow Zombie. This zombie is tougher, faster and has the appearance of Yeti - a mysterious creature that lives in Himalaya.
